## 2. Family and Household Transition

### Key Drivers
- People live longer, have fewer children, move to cities.  
- Households not solely created by marriage nor ended by death.  

### Trends
- Later marriage → Cohabitation → Nonmarital childbearing  
- Higher divorce rates  
- Women’s improved education and work → Lower fertility  
- Childlessness increasing  
- Widowhood shifted to older age groups  

### Family Composition (Thailand)
- Family size shrinking  
- Nuclear family still dominant but declining  
- Extended family and one-person households increasing  
- DINK (Double Income No Kid), SINK (Single Income No Kid) emerging  

### Skipped-generation Households (Thailand, 2007)
| Region       | % Elderly in skip-generation HH |
|--------------|---------------------------------|
| Nationwide   | 7%                              |
| Northeast    | 15%                             |
| Bangkok      | 2.1%                            |
| Central      | 8.6%                            |
| North        | 12.4%                           |
| South        | 8.9%                            |

**Insight**: Skip-generation households concentrated in rural/Isaan areas due to migration of working-age adults.

- Easier divorce laws → Divorce more common than widowhood before 65.  
- Shift in caregiving burden → Skip-generation & sandwich generation more visible.
